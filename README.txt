Widget that provides a simple way to include an "About Me" bio and mugshot in the sidebar.

== Description ==

This plugin is a simple way to put up a widget that says something about you (like the Profile Gadget on Blogspot/Blogger). It also includes a mugshot and title.

Features
* Choose user profile to display
* Use several about widgets for several authors
* Custom widget titles
* Grabs Gravatar for a mugshot

While working for Author Media, I noticed that all the plugins for making a box like this were either not widgetized, looked horrible, or ridiculously complex. This plugin is simple and to the point. It grabs a title, your user description, and gravatar. That's it.

The Author Bio widget: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/author-bio-widget/ rendered very poorly, not even using the standard widget title layout.
The About Me widget: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about-me-widget/screenshots/ is totally overkill; who need a rich text editor built into their about page? The most complicated thing to do is add a picture.
The same goes for About me 3000: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about-me-3000

That's why I made this plugin. If you don't need to use three different colors to your "About Me" burb, this is the plugin for you. I just wrote this plugin over the weekend and it's my first official submission to the repository, so consider this a beta version.

== Installation ==

Chances are you're doing this automatically, but if not:
1. Unzip simple-about-me.zip to a folder and upload `simple-about-me` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. OR search for it in the plugin repository on your site and click install.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. You should see a new widget appear under Appearence > Widgets.
1. Add this widget to one or more of your sidebars and customize the settings in 

== Coming Soon ==

Future Features
* Author Archive Link
* Custom "about" page link
* Custom description text
* Use local images (not just your gravatar)
* Social Media links

I would love to get feedback on this plugin at my Wordpress.com blog: http://BrianFactor.Wordpress.com/project-sam/
A little link luv would help. And money might make these features pop out faster.

I am also unsure about backward compatibility. I know versions 2.2- don't have widgets built in. Past that, I'm not sure. But this has been tested with the latest version of Wordpress.
